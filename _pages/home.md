**Our mission is to create methods to fit the science and not make science fit the methods.** 

Specifically, we are interested in the following questions that have clinical relevance:

1. **Neurodegeneration** -- How can we develop software frameworks that can assist neurology practitioners in various real-world settings? 
2. **Digital pathology** -- How can we build clinical-grade software tools to complement the pathologist workflow?

We are also interested in the following frameworks that have computational relevance:

1. **Multimodal machine learning** -- Efficient design of AI agents for multimodal data processing with incomplete information.
2. **Representation learning** -- Construction of efficient neural networks on high resolution data to process local and contextual information.

### Joining our laboratory
We form small teams comprising individuals with complementary expertise and work persistently to build comprehensive solutions. 

**Important:** If you are interested in joining us, then we encourage you to contact an active lab member (click on Team) and talk about your interests.
